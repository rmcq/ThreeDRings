#  Changelog
Version 2.0 uploaded on 4/6/22
- Rewritten as whole new project to allow use of UIScene stuff, since the external screen connection notification kept firing multiple times and the external screen would be blank until a new chart was selected, and I couldn't fix it.

Version 2.1
- Fixed siri button not enabling for first chart on opening.
- Fixed table view now selects correct row when chart changes (including from Shortcuts)
- Fixed rotation buttons working correctly and rotationi from Shortcuts working correctly.
